## In a nutshell

By analyzing data from nearly all US PhD-recipients and their dissertations across three decades, this paper finds demographically underrepresented students innovate at higher rates than majority students, but their novel contributions are discounted and less likely to earn them academic positions. The discounting of minoritiesâ€™ innovations may partly explain their underrepresentation in influential positions of academia.

## Code

With the provided code the novelty, impactful novelty, and distal novelty metrics can be constructed from the ProQuest dissertation abstract data.

- ***stms_estimate_at_K.R***: Runs Structural Topic Models at specified range of K (50-1000 in the paper).
- ***concepts_k500_50.R***: Extracts concepts from the structural topic model output, the number of words, topics, and FREX weighing can be adjusted in the code to get at the differend K/FREX scenarios.
- ***proquest-skipgrams.py***: Code to learn the concept embeddings to find out which are distal or proximal linkages.
- ***elastic_search_proquest_hyphen_removed_filtered_concepts.py***: Sample code to put documents into Elastic Search (see https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/02/02/how-to-query-elasticsearch-with-python/)
- ***obtain_innovation_years_proquest_msearch_chunks_only_hits_filtered.py***: Looks up each dyad and dumps when it was first introduced, introduced thesis ID and future uptakes for that dyad.
- ***merge_innovations_uptakes_files.py***: Aggregates uptakes etc. by thesis ID.

## Logic for computing novelty and uptake

We seek to compute the number of uptakes for each dyad and then aggregate across a document. To find the number of uptakes of a concept dyad, we first find the first theses in which the dyad was introduced which in turn needs us to identify all theses that used the link and then obtain the thesis that is the earliest as the introducing thesis (by graduation year). The rest of the dyads are the future uptakes. This logic an be implemented in many ways based on your needs. Below we point to one such implementation that was suited for compute infrastructure. Note that the below implementation by its design requires customization because of the heavy setup needed. We chose this approach because envisioned future projects that needed this anyways where we needed efficient ways of identifying theses that contained a given set of terms.  

We implement the above by building a search engine that returns documents (theses) that contain a term. In particular, we query the search engine (Elastic Search) for each dyad and obtain number of documents/theses that are hits (i.e., that contain the dyad) as well as their publication years sorted in ascending order by year. The first is the thesis that introduced the link (dyad) (ties are broken arbitrarily) and the rest of hits correspond to the total number of uptakes for that dyad. The idea is to store each thesis (document) in Elastic search along with meta data (like graduation year, identifier, etc.). Then we can efficiently use Elastic Search's functionality to retrieve theses that contain a given dyad: obtain_innovation_years_proquest_msearch_chunks_only_hits_filtered.py. We had to do this in chunks because of restricted memory/compute requirements. The outputs of these are then just aggregated across each thesis to obtain (a) The number of links (b) the total uptakes of dyads and the (c) mean distal score introduced by the thesis. 

## Data

For the concepts extracted for the K = 500 Structural Topic Model where we equally balance frequency and exclusivity (which we extract in **concepts_k500_50.R**), please see **k500_wordcouds_n_to_n.zip** for visualizations or **frexconcepts_k500_50.rda** for the data (second element in the list).
